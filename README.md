Pysnow's author is hard at work building a new simple and lightweight yet powerful and extensible Python 3.7+ asyncio library for working with ServiceNow called *Snow*. It's in alpha (beta shortly) and currently provides *Table API* CRUD features, check it out at [rbw/snow](https://github.com/rbw/snow).
